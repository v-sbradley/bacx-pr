# Images, screenshots, and GIFs

Images are an important part of the release plans. They provide visual context for features, and helps the customer understand the benenfits and functions of our products. When you submit an image in the release planner app it will get uploaded to the Master branch for that particular repo. It's important to consider the following before you submit your images. 

## Image Dos

- Complete the Alt-text
  - Alt-text is necessary to confirm with accessiblity standards
  - It should be a detailed description of the image, including keywords, that's no more than 125 characters (screen readers tend to cut off at that length)
  - Provides some SEO value to your feature

- Use clear screenshots/images
  - If it's blurry for you, it will be worse when live

- Ensure all the data, names, addresses, profile images, and other contnet is CELA approved.
  - You will need to confirm this by toggling the check before you submit your image. 

- Use images with clear content if its meant to be readable. 

## Image Don'ts

- Don't use copyrighted images. 
- Don't submit an image unless you are have confirmed that the information it contains is allowed to be seen by the public. 
- Don't take screenshots of your entire desktop if it's not pertitnent to the image. 

## GIFs

- GIFs are being used more often as a way to enhance the feature information, but they come with their own considerations.
  - They cannot auto-loop. They must display once, and if the customer wants to see it again, they must refresh the screen. This is an accessbility issue. 
  - The steps and information in the Gif must be documented in the feature description as well. This will lengthen the description but it's necessary for accessbilty. 
  - It cannot be larger than *size*.
