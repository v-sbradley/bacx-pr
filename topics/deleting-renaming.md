# Deleting or renaming topic files

## Deleting topic files

Deleting a topic in GitHub mean that any existing links to the topic will error on docs.microsoft.com. To give customers a better experience, we can put redirections in place.

There are also localization considerations with deletions. If a file is out for localization when it is deleted, the localization handback with fail.

Here is the best practice for deleting a file.

 -  Writer/Editor updates TOC, planned features, change history, and any other topics referencing the removed content. They then coordinate the appropriate reviews and push the changes to "master"
   > [!NOTE]
   > These changes can be pushed live at any time. They will effectively hide the removed content from users. Actually deleting/renaming the topic needs to be timed with localization.
 -	Writer/Editor opens TFS item, using [this template](https://dynamicscrm.visualstudio.com/OneCRM/CRM.Internal.CPub.ContentEngineering/_workitems/create/Task?templateId=5f40a615-c903-4905-9240-2c720bd56075&ownerId=b9f83a31-db17-49e3-848b-c891c5b1e1c1), for CE listing topics to delete, and redirection target for each deleted topic
 -	CE coordinates timing with localization
 -	CE deletes topic(s), and implements redirect(s) in a working branch
 -	CE opens PR from working branch to "master", adds Writer/Editor as reviewer
 -	When approved by Writer/Editor, CE merges to "master" and deletes working branch


## Renaming a topic file

   > [!WARNING]
   > Changing a topic file name can break a localization handback.

**Topic file names should not be changed**. Changing a topic file name can break a localization handback, cause significant additional localization cost, and create errors for customers.

If you have a business case for renaming a topic file, contact [crmce](mailto:crmce@microsoft.com) and outline your reasons for the rename. If your case is approved by AnnBe, Content Publishing Director, your Cpub contacts will work with you to implement the rename.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The approval bar for file renaming is very high. The risk of breaking a localization handback is high, so approvals will be rare exceptions.
