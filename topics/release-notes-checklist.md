Use this checklist to make all the necessary consistency changes to your Release Notes topics when you revise them or review a PR from a PM:
- **Metadata:**
  - Update the ms.date value.
  - Make sure the right authors are listed for ms.author, author, and ms.reviewer.
- **Change history:**
  - If a PM or you made a change, make sure it's represented in the Change history topic.
  - For features that are not scheduled, put "Undetermined" in the **Target release** month column. 
  - For features that are *both* not scheduled and might ship after the current release notes timeframe, put "Undetermined (may release after March 2019)". 
- When the feature ships, add links to the published documentation for it in the feature description topic. 
- For the September update for Ignite, for anything held back until that day, in the **Changed date** column, use "Sept. 24".
