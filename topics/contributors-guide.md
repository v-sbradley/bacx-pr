# Contributors guide for PMs/Devs

This guide provides information on how PMs and other members from the feature

- Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (CE)
    - Dynamics 365 for Sales
    - Dynamics 365 for Customer Service
    - Dynamics 365 for Project Service and Field Service
    - Dynamics 365 for Marketing
    - Social Engagement
- Microsoft Flow

- Power platform

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Folks who already contribute to Release Notes repo**: You are all set to contribute; you don't need to request additional access. Jump on to [Work directly in our repos](work-repos.md)
> - **PowerApps and Flow PMs who already contribute to docs**: Currently, use the (legacy) forking model, which is still supported. This guide introduces them to work directly in their own branches in our repo by granting **"write"** access. You are already familiar with this model from your work on Release Notes. See [Get started](get-started.md) to request write access to PowerApps and Flow repos.
> - **Benefits of working directly in our repo over forking**: You don't have to create a pull request to view you changes on the review site on docs. Committing a change in your branch automatically provides you with a review link on docs. If everything looks good, you can create a pull request to merge it with master and publish live!
