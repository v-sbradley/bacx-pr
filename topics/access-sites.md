# Request access to restricted sites

Submit requests to view and work in sites you use, such as the following:

- **Azure DevOps boards**

  Contact the admin (<buckley.guderian@microsoft.com>) to ask about access to ADO boards. You might be able to access some task boards but not others. 

- **SharePoint sites** (those that allow external accounts)
 
  Use your new email account to request access to SharePoint sites. Note that many sites might be internal only.

- **Microsoft Style Guide and Policheck**

  For access to these tools, you need a user manager to submit a request. Your agency might have a user manager who can do this. If not, ask your Microsoft manager to make the request. 
  
  [Vendor access to Global Readiness tools](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/globalreadiness/KBLibrary/Forms/All%20properties.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fglobalreadiness%2FKBLibrary%2F1805%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Fglobalreadiness%2FKBLibrary) explains how to set up a user manager and how the user manager requests access for individuals.
